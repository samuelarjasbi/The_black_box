# The black box

## Introduction

We were ambitious. That was our mindset. Hard work was what we were doing but there is a quote that says “Work smart not just hard”
In 2019 we Start a project called Hemmat with a great team. Our goal was to design an Expert bot for the Iranian stock market but in our project, this bot could be even more expert. I'll tell you in a moment what I mean. We had a complete team of expert traders and also great developers with knowledge of software architecture.
In the beginning, let me explain what is an expert bot. Expert bots are an automation code for scanning the whole target stock market and listing the best available stocks for trading as export. Sometimes, AI scientists mixed automation codes and AI and Machine learning codes to gather and make a smart bot and not only an automation bot. Expert bots are available on the market for renting or buying but you have to be careful because most sellers are scammers and they give you a useless bot and then the only thing you achieve is bankruptcy. You can find it as Black Box trading bots, forex automation bots, and expert bots.



### Idea

Our main idea was to design an expert bot not only for detecting the best stocks bot to trade automatically. 
For starters, you have to recognize a pattern for trading that trading experts call the Strategy.

#### Strategy
Designing a strategy requires a lot of knowledge and experience in that specific market and also you must have great knowledge of traders and market behavior to recognize the patterns. As a result, you can discover a pattern for forecasting future happens in the market, but these strategies are not always accurate and they have the amount of errors percentage but competitions are about the percentage of accuracy. There is a conceptual formula for accuracy percentage “ in a strategy always we have failures and errors, but let's say we want to calculate accuracy or interest percentage per month, then you have to multiply your earned money in that month by 100, and divided by your base money (money you had at the start of the month) so it is your interest percent per month”, most of the beginner traders have 1% profit or in other meaning, they have no much profit also they lose their money. In addition, a lot of the expert traders have between 10% to 20% profit and that is amazing interest percent because for example if you trade with 1000$ and keep your interest percent at 10% for every month in a year. Also, add your monthly profit to your trading money. At the end of the year, you have a 213% interest rate and your total money would be 3,138$, but with a regular interest rate after a year you got 2,200$ and 120% interest.
